  <h1 align="center" style="color:#E36C0A;">American parents and how to develop children’s creativity?</h1>
  <p>American preschool experts believe that every child has limitless creativity and their nature should be liberated. Parents and teachers should guide them scientifically and reasonably as to develop their limitless creativity. B.B.PAW preschool experts make the following six suggestions to stimulate a children’s creativity:</p> 
  <b>1. Encouraging children to play different roles</b> 
  <p>Let 3 or 5 kids play different roles in Shakespeare dramas, cartoon clips, self-made drama, dance, mime, etc.</p>

  <b>2. Encouraging children to make homemade gifts</b> 
  <p>During the festival seasons, parents should encourage kids to make full use of existing material at home to self-make gifts, instead of spending money to buy ready-made gifts. So we recommend making greetings cards, toy models, paper cut outs, etc.</p>

  <b>3.Encourage children to hold a small family party</b> 
  <p>Children can be encouraged to invite their friends to hold a family party. Activities can involve cleaning, decorating, preparing food, playing games or shows, etc. These activities improve their sociability, life skills and creative thinking, at the same time.</p>

  <b>4. Letting children play different kind of games</b> 
  <p>Kids can be encouraged to play games such as idioms, solitaire, word connection and intelligence tests, or tell jokes and participate in various sports games</p>  
  <p align="center"><img width="685" height="315" src="img_1280/02/4-8.jpg" /></p>  
  <b>5. Letting children concentrate</b> 
  <p>The more concentration, the more creative they will be. Kids can take part in activities with strong hands-on skills, such as cutting wood, folding paper planes, washing clothes and so on.</p>  
  <p align="center"><img width="685" height="315" src="img_1280/02/5-8.jpg" /></p>  
  <b>6.Encouraging children to ask questions</b> 
  <p>Children always have thousand of questions, and parents should encourage them to ask more, and answer patiently. Therefore, children will naturally have new ideas and think about the questions they’ve asked, and creativity will be formed gradually.</p>
