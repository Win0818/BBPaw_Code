  <h1 align="center" style="color:#E36C0A;">American Experts Training Babies to Be “Multi-tasking”</h1>
  <p>A special study has been cooperatively confirmed by American behaviorists, psychologists and education experts, that children can focus on 2-3 things at the same time, while adults can focus on 4-6 things or even more. Even for a 1-year-old baby just learning to walk, it can take faltering steps while listening to your advice. So it totally can be “Multi-tasking” for a normal person.</p>

  <p>Like “Concentration”, its “Distribution” must also be nurtured. It is particularly crucial to consciously cultivate this in infants. Studies have shown that for the babies who can easily complete “multi-tasking” Training, when they need to focus on attention, in turn their abilities have improved, such as lasting persistence, rapid response, body coordination, strong memory, and creativity</p>
  <p>American experts suggest babies in different ages should receive multi-task training step by step.</p>
